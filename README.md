# Student-Attendance-System-for-collages
1) Main Purpose
The project aims to replace traditional manual attendance registers with an automated system that can:
Record student attendance accurately.
Capture a snapshot of the student via the camera to verify identity.
Track login and exit times for both students and faculty.
Provide daily and monthly attendance reports.
Calculate attendance percentage automatically for the month.
Differentiate roles: student vs. faculty, giving appropriate access to each.
